    <p> Hi, my name is <b>Daryle Smith</b> and Im currently a Ph.D student at North Carolina A&T State University.</p>
    <p>I currently live in <em>Statesville, NC</em> and I have two daughters ages ten and three.</p>
    <p>I was born in <em>Lenoir, NC</em> in 1985 and when my parents got married we all moved to a really small town, <em>Harmony, NC</em>.</p>
    <p>I started gaining interest in computers around the 5th grade and just continued along that journey of researching and learning
    new things.
        <p>After high school I enrolled in college at <u>Winston Salem State University</u> where I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in
        computer science.</p>

    <p> Hi, my name is <b>Daryle Smith</b> and I'm a Ph.D student in Computer Science at North Carolina A&T State University</p>
    <p>I currently live in <em>Statesville, NC</em> and have two daughters ages ten and three</p>
    <p>I was born in <em>Lenoir, NC</em> in 1985 and when my parents got married we all moved to a really small town called <em>Harmony</em> in NC</p>
    <p>I started gaining interest in computers around the 5th grade and just continued along that journey of researching and learning
    new things
        <p>After high school I attended college at <u style="color: red;">Winston Salem State University</u> and completed my BS and MS degrees, both in
        Computer Science</p>
   </p>
    <p>Im currently working as a Technology Architect and I've been employed in the IT industry as a developer a little over 10 years now</p>
    <p>My currents interests and hobbies are around Kubernetes, Python, Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, and building apps</p>
    <p>I'm also the co-founder of a business, along with 2 others, called Data and Cloud Solutions LLC</p>
    <p>Even though we primarily take on work involving system design and development, we have also started investigating an approach to creating our own programming language</p>

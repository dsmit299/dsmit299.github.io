    <p> Hi, my name is <b>Daryle Smith</b> and I'm a Ph.D student in Computer Science at North Carolina A&T State University.</p>
    <p>I currently live in <em>Statesville, NC</em> and have two daughters ages ten and three.</p>
    <p>I was born in <em>Lenoir, NC</em> in 1985 and when my parents got married we all moved to a really small town called <em>Harmony</em> in NC.</p>
    <p>I started gaining interest in computers around the 5th grade and just continued along that journey of researching and learning
    new things.
        <p>After high school I enrolled in college at <u style="color: red;">Winston Salem State University</u> where I completed my BS and MS degrees in
        Computer Science.</p>
   </p>
    <p>Im currently working as a Technology Architect and I've been employed in the IT industry as a developer a little over 10 years now</p>
    <p>My currents interests and hobbies are around Kubernetes, Python, Cloud Computing, and Data Analytics</p>
    <p>I've also just recently started a business with 2 other peers where we are gathering ideas about creating our own programming language</p>

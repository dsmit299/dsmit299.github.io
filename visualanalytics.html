    Visual Analytics is considered a set of tools to help users investigate certain scenarios which predict specific and unk results.
    Commonly, VA is used in major areas such as physcis and astrology.  Sensors, satellites, etc, also contribute to another area that uses
    VA...climate. In terms of climate, large amounts of data can be analyzed, which can then help formulate an unexpected outcome thats not easily found.
    As far as emergency situations caused by mother nature, VA can help determine next steps to lessen the damage.  Terrorism, border protection, and
    and medicine can all be used to gather analytics with VA.

    The VA process starts with the transformation of data.  Once the data has been processed, a user could choose between applying visual or automatic analysis methods.
    With automated analysis, data mining methods are used to generate models of the original data and once done the analyst can evaluate and refine the models.
    Visualizations allow the analysts to unite with the automatic methods by reforming parameters or selecting other analytical principles.
    Findings in the visualisations can be used to steer model building which then results in knowledge to the analyst.
    In summary, analysts use the VA process to:
    -   gather data
    -   change the data to get an outcome
    -   visually represent the data or use methods to derive or form a conclusion
    -   Use the conclusion as a form of knowledge

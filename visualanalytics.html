    Visual Analytics is considered a set of tools that help users investigate scenarios which predict specific and unknown results.
    Its commmon that VA is used in major areas such as physcis and astrology, however, it covers a vast majority of other areas.
    In terms of climate, large amounts of data can be analyzed to help formulate an unexpected outcome that's not easily found. These
    outcomes, for example, can help a meteorologist specualte where weather patterns are chainging.
    As far as emergency situations caused by mother nature, VA can help determine next steps to lessen the damage.  Terrorism, border protection,
    and medicine can all be used to gather analytics with VA.

    The VA process starts with the transformation of data.  Once that data has been processed, an analyst can choose between applying visual or automatic analysis methods.
    With automated analysis, data mining methods are used to generate models of the original data and once done the analyst can evaluate and refine the models.
    Visualizations allow the analysts to unite with the automatic methods by reforming parameters or selecting other analytical principles.
    Findings in the visualizations ultimately results in obtaining knowledge.
    In summary, analysts use the VA process to:
    -   gather data
    -   change the data to get an outcome
    -   visually represent the data or use methods to derive or form a conclusion
    -   Use the conclusion as a form of knowledge
